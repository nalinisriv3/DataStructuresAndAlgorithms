# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
Welcome to Data Structures and Algorithms Questions, Solutions and Tutorials.
Below is an structured way for learning DSA which includes the courses you can take, problems you can solve and solution to them so that you get a deeper understanding of how things work.
It is recommended to practice problems as much as possible but also try to code by hand on a paper it will challenge you and you will get a clear understanding of the concepts you implement. For example, if you implement an array do it on a paper and try to write production level code.
